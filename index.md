## About me

I am a researcher in the Microeconomic Analysis division at the Banque de France, with expertise in law and economics, corporate finance, and banking.

Before joining the Banque de France, I was a research fellow at France Stratégie. I earned my PhD in economics from the LEDa (Laboratoire d’Économie de Dauphine – Université PSL) in 2023, under the supervision of Anne Epaulard, as part of a CIFRE contract with the Banque de France. My thesis offers an economic analysis of bankruptcy laws in France, focusing in particular on preventive procedures, the rebound of firms after restructuring and the efficiency of (small) commercial courts in deciding whether to save or liquidate distressed firms.
